# setMeshEngine
Building up a mesh engine specially designed for finite volumes with adaptive mesh refinement capabilities based on balanced octrees.

The project will have modular sections which could serve for different purposes, the actual one on development is:

1. Pre-processor a class environment designed to create structured meshes for large domains. Geometry is no longer to be much complex
in verification and validation stages of the solver so until reach this point mesh engine will keep simple enought to run.

Up to now, the repository was created to help me having a remote repository, so even being public access is under development.
